<p><strong>Youtube Clone:</strong> In this project, I used HTML and CSS to recreate the Youtube homepage. It was my very first project and it taught me a lot about CSS properties and the basic HTML structure of a page. The videos on the page are all from YouTube channels that I like to watch. It also redirects to the actual videos and channels if you click the video and channel name respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Google Search:</strong> In this project, I used HTML and CSS again to recreate the Google Search page. The main difference is that there is a bit of functionality. If you type into the search bar and try to search something, it will bring up the searched text via the actual Google Search.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon RPG:</strong> In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was my first time using JavaScript and building this taught me the fundamentals, including arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. The game is simple in that you can use gold to buy weapons, fight slimes, and buy health points to finally beat the Dragon. There is also an easter egg in the game which was also fun to program.</p>

<p><strong>Date Formatter:</strong> The code gets the current date and time, formats it in different ways based on the user's selection, and displays it in an HTML paragraph element. The user can select the desired date format from a dropdown list, and the code updates the paragraph element accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Calorie Counter:</strong>
A simple calorie counter web application made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can enter the food that they ate along with the calories, and also enter any exercise that they did and it calculates the calorie surplus or deficit. This taught me how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results. I also used the JavaScript I already knew, plus basic regular expressions, template literals, event listener methods, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Music Player:</strong> This code is a simple web-based MP3 player that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a list of songs. Users can also shuffle the playlist and delete songs. The code uses JavaScript to manage the playlist, handle user input, and interact with the HTML Audio Element to play audio. In this mini project I used the JavaScript that I have already learnt, plus a few more new techniques such as find, forEach, map, and join.</p>
